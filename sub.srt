1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Hum.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,040
Oh!

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,040
Important meeting.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,000
Everyone must come.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,480
Well, back to work!

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,160
And my boss has called a meeting.

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,720
I wonder what it's about.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,160
Maybe we're all getting raises!

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,239
Ooo, there's Jonathan!

10
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:20,239
Maybe he knows.

11
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,199
Hi!

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,199
I'm Professor Bot!

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,039
This video is all about work.

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,679
People talk about jobs and things that happen at work.

15
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:36,479
Your assignment is to find as many work words as you can.

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,079
Don't worry, I'll help.

17
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,240
So, Jonathan, what do you think today's meeting is about?

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,840
The email sounded important.

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,640
Well, I have heard people in the building talking about budget cuts.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,560
Oh!

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,280
Budget cuts?

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,119
Wait, who has been talking about budget cuts?

23
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,679
Mark in Accounting.

24
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,719
Mark in Accounting?

25
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,079
That's one person.

26
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,239
That's not “people.”

27
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:08,239


28
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,400
I know, but Mark knows everything that goes on at The Studio.

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,359
That is true.

30
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,920
But wait, look at us.

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,640
We shouldn't gossip.

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,159
That's how rumors start.

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,560
We'll just go to the meeting and see what happens.

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,680
You're right.

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,640
No more talk about budget cuts.

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,599
Budget cuts?

37
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:37,799
Oh no!

38
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,680
I just heard Anna and Jonathan talking about budget cuts.

39
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,519
That must be what the meeting is about.

40
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,519
When there are budget cuts, people lose their jobs.

41
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,040
Not you.

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,120
You're a good reporter.

43
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,760
And it's not you.

44
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,879
You've done a great job as a videographer.

45
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,920
I can't go back to being a detective.

46
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,719
Criminals scare me!

47
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,519
And I can't go back to being a teacher!

48
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,919
High school kids scare me!

49
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,280
Did you hear any work words?

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,479
They talked about a lot of jobs.

51
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,759
You can make the name of a job by adding an ending to a verb!

52
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,199
Kaveh reports, so, he's a reporter.

53
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:32,199
Amelia used to detect, so she was a detective.

54
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:35,520
If you teach, you're a teacher.

55
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,039
And a videographer….uh, I think you understand.

56
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,680
Back to the story.

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,599
Penelope, have you heard the news?

58
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,919
Today's meeting is about budget cuts.

59
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,400
That's awful!

60
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,759
What should I do?

61
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,479
Update your résumé.

62
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,240
I’ve already updated mine.

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,120
I’ll see you at the meeting.

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,360
Hello everyone!

65
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,840
Quiet, please.

66
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,759
Quiet, please!

67
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,560
This meeting won’t take long.

68
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,280
Then you can all leave.

69
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,080
What is wrong with everyone?

70
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,560
You look like I'm going to fire you.

71
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,560
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

72
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,599
Seriously, what is wrong with everyone?

73
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,840
Excuse me, Ms.

74
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,439
Weaver?

75
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,800
Yes, Anna.

76
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:34,120
Well, everyone has been worrying about, you know … We’ve been worrying that you are going to fire us!

77
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,840
I’m not going to fire any of you!

78
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
No!

79
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,719
The reason for this meeting is to tell you what a good job you’ve been doing and give out new assignments.

80
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,159
Budget cuts have been happening.

81
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,960
But only one person has lost their job -- Mark in Accounting?

82
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,879
Now, let’s talk about those new assignments.

83
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,879
Ms.

84
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,199
Weaver's team is doing a good job!

85
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,560
How did you do?

86
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,319
Did you find all of the work words?

87
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,000
Here's a list you can check.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,719
